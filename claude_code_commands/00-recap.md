# Recap
This file contains recap for next steps.

- [x] Saved few-shot examples.
- [x] Written experiments for pointing.
- [ ] Add open-source models such as Llava, Qwen2.5-vl
- [ ] Improve pointing by changing how pointing works.
- [ ] Add experiments for getting presence result only.

Current problems:
1. For pointing experiments, few-shot improves checking if something is present, but doesn't improve for pointing at the specific organ. Need to have better way to eliciting response from LLM.
