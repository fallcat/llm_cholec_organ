# 11. Bounding Box Implementation for Organ Localization

**Date**: September 4, 2024  
**Purpose**: Implement bounding box-based localization as an alternative to point-based organ detection, enabling IoU-based evaluation metrics.

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of bounding box support for organ localization in the CholecSeg8k dataset, providing an alternative to single-point localization that can be evaluated using IoU (Intersection over Union) metrics.

## Key Components Created

### 1. MedSAM Integration (`tests/test_medsam.py`)
- Enhanced to extract all possible regions from an image
- `run_medsam_all_regions()`: Generates multiple bounding boxes using grid/sliding window approaches
- `merge_overlapping_masks()`: Merges overlapping segmentation masks based on IoU
- `extract_connected_components()`: Extracts individual connected regions
- Supports multiple disconnected segments per organ

### 2. PeskaVLP Baseline (`tests/test_peskavlp.py`)
- Implements organ detection using vision-language similarity
- Threshold-based classification for organ presence
- Multiple prompt strategies (simple, descriptive, surgical, mixed)
- Optimal threshold finding based on F1 score
- Standalone evaluation pipeline with CholecSeg8k integration

### 3. Bounding Box Few-Shot Preparation

#### Initial Attempt: `prepare_fewshot_examples_bounding_box.py`
- Standalone script using same seed as point version
- **Issue**: Different random selection implementation led to different examples being selected
- Even with same seed (44), the indices didn't match the point-based version

#### Solution: `convert_point_to_bbox_plan.py`
- Loads existing point-based few-shot plans
- Keeps EXACT SAME example indices
- Only changes annotations from points to bounding boxes
- Ensures perfect consistency for fair comparison

### 4. Key Functions

```python
def extract_bounding_boxes_from_mask(
    lab_t: torch.Tensor, 
    class_id: int,
    min_pixels: int = 50,
    min_bbox_size: int = 20,
    max_bboxes: int = 3
) -> List[Tuple[int, int, int, int]]:
    """
    Extract bounding boxes from segmentation mask.
    Returns boxes for disconnected segments.
    """
```

Features:
- Handles disconnected organ segments
- Returns up to 3 bounding boxes per organ
- Filters by minimum pixel count and bbox size
- Prioritizes largest segments

## Data Format

### Bounding Box JSON Structure:
```json
{
  "name": "Liver",
  "positives": [
    {
      "idx": 6636,
      "bboxes": [[x1, y1, x2, y2], [x1, y1, x2, y2]],  // Multiple boxes for disconnected segments
      "main_bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2],                    // Primary/largest bbox
      "original_point": [x, y]                          // Reference to original point
    }
  ],
  "negatives_easy": [151, 324],
  "negatives_hard": [2472]
}
```

## Results Summary

### Consistency Verification:
- ✅ Same test set: `balanced_indices_train_100.json` (100 samples)
- ✅ Same training examples: Verified exact index matches
- ✅ Multiple bboxes support: Successfully handles disconnected segments
  - Liver: 2 boxes
  - Fat: 2 boxes  
  - Blood: 3 boxes

### Statistics:
- Total positive examples: 12 organs
- Total bounding boxes: 16 (average 1.33 per organ)
- Organs with multiple segments: 3 out of 12

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Generate Bounding Box Few-Shot Examples:
```bash
# Option 1: Convert from existing point plan (RECOMMENDED for consistency)
cd /shared_data0/weiqiuy/llm_cholec_organ/notebooks_py
python convert_point_to_bbox_plan.py

# Option 2: Generate new bbox plan (will have different examples)
python prepare_fewshot_examples_bounding_box.py
```

### 2. Use for Evaluation:
```python
# Load the converted bbox plan for consistent comparison
bbox_plan_file = "data_info/cholecseg8k/fewshot_bbox_plan_converted_from_point_seed44.json"
```

### 3. Run Baseline Methods:
```bash
# PeskaVLP baseline
python tests/test_peskavlp.py

# MedSAM region extraction
python tests/test_medsam.py
```

## Key Learnings

1. **Seed Consistency Issue**: Same random seed doesn't guarantee same selection if implementation differs
2. **Solution**: Direct conversion from existing plans ensures exact consistency
3. **Multiple Segments**: ~25% of organs appear as disconnected segments requiring multiple bboxes
4. **Evaluation**: IoU metrics can now be computed for bbox vs ground truth masks

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Create bbox evaluation script with IoU metrics
2. ✅ Compare performance: pointing vs cell selection vs bounding box
3. ⬜ Implement IoU@0.5, IoU@0.75 thresholds
4. ⬜ Add bbox visualization in evaluation pipeline
5. ⬜ Create comprehensive comparison table in paper

## Technical Notes

### Why Conversion is Necessary:
Even with identical seeds, different implementations of the selection algorithm produce different results due to:
- Order of operations
- Different filtering approaches  
- Numpy vs pure Python random selection
- Candidate pool construction differences

### Ensuring Fairness:
The `convert_point_to_bbox_plan.py` approach ensures:
- Identical training examples
- Identical test set
- Only the annotation format differs (point → bbox)
- Fair comparison between localization methods

## Files for Paper

- **Primary bbox plan**: `fewshot_bbox_plan_converted_from_point_seed44.json`
- **Test set**: `balanced_indices_train_100.json` 
- **Visualization**: `fewshot_bbox_visualization.png`

This implementation provides a robust foundation for comparing different organ localization strategies (pointing, cell selection, bounding boxes) with appropriate evaluation metrics.
